		<h4>This year's theme, Military and Veteran Children: A Constellation of Strengths and Challenges, will be complemented by four strands that will emphasize moving beyond entry-level awareness and offer innovative ideas, active hands-on learning, and critical information relevant to attendees dedicated to serving the military-connected child. Sessions will be rooted in the following:</h4>

  				<h4>Using Data Effectively (D2K2P)</h4>
  				<p>Emerging research on military-connected students and the resulting data has provided us with both challenges and opportunities.  Those challenges include analyzing, understanding, sharing and managing a considerable amount of statistics and data with respect to the educational opportunities for military and veteran connected children.  Evolving opportunities include beneficial innovations and practices that will better inform decisions made by educators and other youth serving professionals, parents, and military leaders who are both advocating and collaborating to serve the educational needs of military and veteran connected children.  Sessions in the D2K2P strand will help attendees translate research Data into personal Knowledge that is gained and can be applied in Practice in both our professional and personal lives to support military-connected students.  </p>

  				<h4>Social Emotional Learning (SEL)</h4>
  				<p>All young people need supports and opportunities to build their character and promote positive relationships while making a successful transition to adulthood.  Extended family separations and repeated transitions have strained our military families and the impact will be felt for years to come. Maintaining a child’s academic requirements and developing a positive sense of self while coping with family stressors presents challenges. Character strengths gained through social and emotional learning provide a key basis of coping. Presentations in the SEL strand will focus on programs, partnerships and best practices that provide measurable results in helping military families and their children thrive in their environment.</p>

  				<h4>Partnering Public and Private Organizations</h4>
  				<p>Robust and collaborative partnerships between public and private organizations is a key component in supporting military-connected students.  MCEC has long applauded outstanding partnerships that exist between military installations, school districts, private organizations, and corporations that truly exemplify that “goodness happens at the local level” while building a community of support.  Sessions in the Partnership strand will highlight examples of exceptional partnerships, as well as, illustrate how to navigate the challenges and maximize the benefits of initiating partnerships in your local military installation or school district that serve the interests of military and veteran connected students.</p>

  			<div class="col-md-8">
  				<h4>Education Policy</h4>
  				<p>Today’s military, corporate, and education leaders understand – many of them through firsthand experience – the challenges military children face in the education system. While many military-connected students encounter challenges that hinder their educational goals, others benefit from programs, practices, and policies that support academic success. Sessions in the Education Policy strand will discuss policy implementations and forces that are leading us in the right direction to support military children, as well as, how education policies can be improved, developed and adapted to better benefit the military and veteran connected students we serve.</p>

		<p>Monday July 31, 2017 | 1:00pm - 5:00pm</p>
		<h5>Overview</h5>
		<p>Most military children embody strength and resiliency, even in the face of multiple challenges. Some military children may be negatively impacted by the stress and trauma that can accompany military family life. This pre-conference event will bring together national leaders from organizations supporting military children and youth presenting on resources and materials including representatives from USO, Military Child Education Coalition, SAMHSA, NCTSN, ZERO TO THREE, T2, Sesame Street and the Military Family Advisory Network (MFAN). Attendees will have the opportunity to hear first-hand about the development of the latest social media and health campaigns, toolkits, mobile apps, screening instruments, and psycho-educational materials to support the psychological well-being of military families and children. Opportunities will be available for attendees to learn how best to access military-informed/trauma-informed resources to support children and families and implement these materials into their own organizational settings. The pre-conference session will include key note presenters, panel presentations and mini-sessions. Active demonstrations will take place using cross-platform social media feeds and Facebook live broadcasts.</p>
